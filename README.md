## Hi, I'm Hind 

&emsp; I graduated with a degree in **Softwear Engneering** a year ago.
what made me continue in this major and made me want to learn web design are the Twitch streamers that I've been following for a long time ,watching them talk about the field of web design and their passion for technology in general made me love my major.
So now my goal is to know everything I need to find a job as a web developer by the end of this year. 

I am a committed person and it is easy for me to learn on my own, most of what I have learned recently has been based on some websites and YouTube channels,
which makes me believe that my will to join the training at the Orange Academy is that I want to develop my social skills more than my technical skills.
During university I was introverted and shy and I did not get to know my colleagues or even my teachers,  after graduation I realized that social relationships  are no less important than a university degree and that it makes many things easier for us.
